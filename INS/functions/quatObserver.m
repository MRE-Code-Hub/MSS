function [quat, b_ars] = quatObserver(quat, b_ars, h, Ki, k1, k2, m_ref, imu_meas)
% quatObserver is compatible with MATLAB and GNU Octave (www.octave.org).
% This function computes the updated unit quaternion q[k+1], representing 
% the orientation between the BODY and NED frames, as well as the bias 
% b_ars[k+1] of the attitude rate sensor (ARS) in a high-performance 
% nonlinear observer (Grip et al 2013). The observer uses high-rate inertial
% measurements from a 9-DOF inertial measurement unit (IMU). The function 
% can be called either as a corrector (with new measurements) or as a 
% predictor (without new measurements). 
%
%   9-DOF measurements:
%      [quat, b_ars] = quatObserver(quat, b_ars, h, Ki, k1, k2, m_ref, ... 
%          [f_imu', w_imu', m_imu'])
%   7-DOF measurements:
%      [quat, b_ars] = quatObserver(quat, b_ars, h, Ki, k1, k2, m_ref, ... 
%          [f_imu', w_imu', psi])
%   6-DOF measurements (no magnetometer/compass measurements):
%      [quat, b_ars] = quatObserver(quat, b_ars, h, Ki, k1, k2, m_ref, ... 
%          [f_imu', w_imu'])
% 
% The injection term is implemented using two reference vectors
%   sigma = k1 * v1 x R'(quat) * v01 + k2 * v2 x R'(quat) * v02
%
% Continuous-time observer (Grip et al. 2013)(Fossen 2021, Eqs. 14.48-14.50)
%   quat_dot = Tquat(w_imu - b_ars + sigma) * quat
%   b_ars_dot = -Ki * sigma
%
% Discrete-time observer using the matrix exponential, which serves as the 
% exponential map for matrix Lie groups, ensuring an exact discretization 
% of the quaternion differential equation: 
%   quat = expm( Tquat(w_imu - b_ars + sigma) * h ) * quat
%   quat = quat / sqrt(quat' * quat)
% 
% Inputs:   
%   quat[k]   - 4x1 vector representing the current quaternion quat[k] 
%               estimate
%   b_ars[k]  - 3x1 vector representing the current bias of the attitude
%               rate sensor (ARS)
%   h         - Sampling time for the observer update 
%   Ki        - 3x3 diagonal integral gain matrix for bias estimation
%   k1        - Gain for the injections term associated with the specific 
%               force measurement vector
%   k2        - Gain for the injection term associated with the magnetic 
%               field measurement vector
%   m_ref     - 3x1 vector representing the reference magnetic field vector
%               expressed in NED. The reference signal m_ref = R^n_b * m_imu 
%               can be computed during initial calibration, see 
%               staticRollPitchYaw.m
%  imu_meas[k] = [f_imu', w_imu', m_imu'] is 1x9 vector with components
%               [fx, fy, fz, wx, wy, wz, mx, my, mz]. More specific, 
%               f_imu[k] is a 3x1 vector representing the IMU specific force 
%               measurements, w_imu[k] is a 3x1 vector representing the IMU 
%               angular velocity measurements, and m_imu[k] is a 3x1 vector 
%               representing the IMU magnetic field measurements. The IMU 
%               axes are assumed to be oriented forward-starboard-down.
%               For compass measurements [f_imu', w_imu', psi] is of dimension 7. 
%
% Outputs:  
%   quat[k+1]  - 4x1 vector representing the updated unit quaternion estimate
%   b_ars[k+1] - 3x1 vector representing the updated ARS bias estimate
%
% The function implements the quaternion-based nonlinear observer for 
% attitude estimation by Grip et al. (2013). The observer updates the 
% quaternion based on specific force and magnetic field measurements while 
% also correcting for ARS bias. The observer employs a feedback mechanism 
% that uses the cross products between the measured vectors and their 
% reference counterparts to compute an injection term, which is used to 
% update the bias and quaternion. USGES stability guarantees robustness to
% bounded disturbances.
